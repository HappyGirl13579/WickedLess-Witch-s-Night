                WickedLess Witch's Night is back! This year we will be donating Weekend Meal Kits for Granite Kids! Student Weekend Kits are sent home in the backpacks of food insecure children within Granite School District schools. The pack contains enough food for four meals and several snacks. Please refer to <a href="https://granitekids.org/get-involved/volunteer/kits.html">their website</a> for more information.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Your donations will pay for the items requested for each kit, which will be ready to assemble. Each $15 ticket is enough to pay for 3 meal kits! At our event, we will be working together to assemble the kits while we Eat, Drink, and Be Witchy!
            </p>
            <br/> 
            <p>
                While a Witch costume is not required, it is HIGHLY recommended! We will be awarding prizes for The Best Witchy Costumes, so wear your witchiest garb! 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                A representative from Granite Kids will be there to answer any questions you may have! Thank you so much for Supporting Us this year!
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                *Dinner price of $35 per person includes drinks. Each donation ticket is $15 and will go towards purchasing all the items that we will be assembling together.
