                    This year, we will be assembling Weekend Meal Kits to donate to Granite Kids! Student Weekend Kits are sent home in the backpacks of food insecure children within Granite School District schools. The pack contains enough food for four meals and several snacks. Your donations will pay for the items requested for each kit, which will be ready to assemble. Each $15 ticket is enough to pay for 3 meal kits! <b>At our event, we will be working together to assemble the meal kits while we Eat, Drink, and Be Witchy!</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your Witchy Self, Your Little Witches, and Your Witchy Friends! Please share the love and help us reach our goal of 180 meal kits!
                </p>
                <p>
                    While a Witch costume is not required, it is HIGHLY recommended! We will be awarding prizes for The Best Witchy Costumes, so wear your witchiest garb!
